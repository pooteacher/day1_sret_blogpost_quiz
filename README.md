# Blogger Quiz Widget â€“ Standalone JavaScript & CSS

This project provides a **quiz widget** that can be embedded in Blogger (or any HTML page) to display multiple-choice questions using a CSV file. The widget is fully client-side, requires no backend, and is mobile-friendly.

## Features

- **CSV Upload:** Users can upload a quiz as a CSV file.
- **Multiple Choice:** Each question supports four options.
- **Instant Feedback:**  
  - If a user clicks the correct answer:  
    - Only the clicked word turns **green** and a random encouragement appears next to it.
  - If a user clicks a wrong answer:  
    - The selected word turns **red** with "missed it", and the correct answer's word is revealed in **green**.
- **Next Button:** Users can proceed to the next question.
- **Fully Responsive:** Works on mobile and desktop.
- **No dependencies except [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) for CSV parsing.**

## CSV Format

The CSV file should have the following headers (first row):

```

```

- Each `optionX` is a possible answer.
- The `answer` column should be the **1-based index** of the correct option (1, 2, 3, or 4).

**Example row:**

```
What is 2+2?,3,4,5,6,2
```
